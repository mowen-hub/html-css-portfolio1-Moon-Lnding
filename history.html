        <ul><b><u>Idea</u></b>
        <p> <li>- President John. F. Kennedy addressed a joint congress. Stated that <i>"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.".
        </i> In 1963, another address was made for the U.S and the Soviet Union to join in the venture, as it was becoming costly and the two nations were in midst of the "Cold War". President Kennedy was later killed that year and the idea never materialised.</li>

        <ul><p><u><b>NASA</b></u>            
            <li>- At NASA, (previously NACA:1915- 1958), a team of scientists and engineers from different countries calculated, designed and built everything for the expedition. Employing over 500,000, both internal and external contractors such as the <i>'Human Computers'</i>.
                 These were individuals that manually calculated trajectories of space craft. Three women who were vital in this were <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-names-headquarters-after-hidden-figure-mary-w-jackson" target="_blank" title="Mary Jackson">Mary Jackson</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/who-was-katherine-johnson-k4" target="_blank" title="Katherine Johnson" >Katherine Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/dorothy-vaughan-biography" target="_blank" title="Dorothy Vaughn">Dorothy Vaughn</a>. All woman recieved numerous accalades for their work.</li>

            <li>- <b>'Apollo 8'</b> tested the same vital systems and components, while also orbiting the Moon taking a total of 6 days.</li>
            <li>- <b>'Apollo 9'</b> took 10 days orbiting Earth fine tuning procedures and checks on crew, vehicles and systems.</li>
