    <h2><strong>Apollo 11 Mission</strong></h2>

    <div>
        <p class="text"> On July 16th, 1969, <b>Commander</b> Neil A. Armstrong, <b>Lunar Module Pilot</b> Edward E. ‘Buzz’ Aldrin Jr and <b>Command Module Pilot</b> Michael Collins, boarded the <strong>Saturn-V</strong>spacecraft, at the Cape Kennedy Space centre.
        The mission was not only to land on the surface of the moon and return but it was also to gather samples and photograph of surface material and terrain.
        They were to also set up a Laser Ranging Refractor, solar wind composition and seismic experiment. While also deploying a television camera to transmit signals back to Earth. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="text"> At 9:32am EDT televisions tuned in across the globe, the engines of the <strong>Saturn-V</strong> fired up and within 12 minutes the crew were in the Earth’s orbit. 
            After orbiting for 1 and half rotations <b>Apollo 11</b> fired the engines again to enter the <i>‘Translunar Injection’</i> stage, which was essentially entering the course towards the moon, which would take 3 days. 
            During this time, on the 17th, the first transmission from the <b>Apollo 11</b> came through in colour to the TVs to all those who were watching. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="text">A second television transmission was made again on the 18th July, with Neil Armstrong and ‘Buzz’ Aldrin, after they moved into the <b>Lunar Module</b>, designated <i>‘Eagle’</i>, through a docking tunnel from the <b>Command Module</b>, designated <i>‘Columbia’</i>. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="text">The day had finally arrived to land on the moon and on the 20th July 1969, the <b>Lunar Module</b> detached from the <b>Command Module</b>, leaving Collins aboard as Armstrong and Aldrin began the decent on top the lunar surface. 
       By the time the <b>Lunar Module</b> landed on the Moon it only had 30 seconds of fuel remaining. Once it had landed in the <i>Sea of Tranquillity</i>, the radio sparked to life with Armstrong uttering the famous quote <i>“Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.”</i> </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="text">Around, 11:00pm EDT, the astronauts leave the <b>Lunar Module</b>, led by Neil Armstrong, and became the first human beings to step onto the Moon, with Armstrong saying another famous quote of “That’s one small step for man, on giant leap for mankind.” 
       Followed closely by Aldrin the pair began to install the devices and collect the samples and take photographs. Before leaving an American Flag was planted, a patch was left to honour the Apollo 1 crew and a plaque, reading <i>"Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.”.</i> </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="text"> Armstrong and Aldrin climbed back aboard the <b>Lunar Module</b> and slept in the Module. At around 14:00pm EDT they fired the engines and blasted off to reconnect to the Command Module with Collins. 
        On 22nd July <b>Apollo 11</b> began its journey back towards Earth, landing in the Pacific Ocean on the 24th July, after an 8 day expedition and fulfilling the challenge put forward but President Kennedy 9 years prior. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="text"> All three astronauts were under a 21-day quarantine. <b>NASA</b> had decided well before the launch that the crew would quarantine before and on re-entry to Earth. So, the crew had to wait the time out in specially dedicated facilities, as they had no idea if returning from the moon would bring back a lunar disease. 
        Once the craft had landed in the Pacific, a Naval swimmer was sent and gave the astronauts isolation clothing. They then climbed aboard the rescue ship and were transfer to the facility via trailer <b>NASA</b> had converted into a home <i>(Mobile Quarantine Facility)</i> and were then flown to Houston to and then connected to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. <br /> <br />
        Inside the facility the crew were joined by around 20 other individuals, as the facility had multiple rooms such as libraries, kitchens and medical stations that could house over 100 people. Those individuals were there to keep an eye on the crew should any problems arise. 
        Once quarantine was over, the crew, their respective wives, State and <b>NASA</b> officials were sent on a world tour, by the Request of President Nixon, visiting 24 countries in 45 days meeting all forms of dignitaries. Starting from Houston, through South America, into Europe, down into Africa, through to Asia, then onto Oceania then back into North America finishing at Washington D.C. </p>
